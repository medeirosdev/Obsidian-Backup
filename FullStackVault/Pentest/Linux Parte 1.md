## Where is Linux Used?
[[Hacking]]
It's fair to say that Linux is a lot more intimidating to approach than Operating System's (OSs) such as Windows. Both variants have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, Linux is considerably much more lightweight and you'd be surprised to know that there's a good chance you've used Linux in some form or another every day! Linux powers things such as:

-   Websites that you visit
-   Car entertainment/control panels
-   Point of Sale (PoS) systems such as checkout tills and registers in shops
-   Critical infrastructures such as traffic light controllers or industrial sensors

## Flavours of Linux

The name "Linux" is actually an umbrella term for multiple OS's that are based on UNIX (another operating system). Thanks to UNIX being open-source, variants of Linux comes in all shapes and sizes - suited best for what the system is being used for.

For example, Ubuntu & Debian are some of the more commonplace distributions of Linux because it is so extensible. I.e. you can run Ubuntu as a server (such as websites & web applications) or as a fully-fledged desktop. For this series, we're going to be using Ubuntu.

_Ubuntu Server can run on systems with only 512MB of RAM_
As we previously discussed, a large selling point of using OSs such as Ubuntu is how lightweight they can be. This, of course, doesn't come without its disadvantages, where for example, often there is no GUI (Graphical User Interface) or what is also known as a desktop environment that we can use to interact with the machine (unless it has been installed). A large part of interacting with these systems is using the "Terminal".

The "Terminal" is purely text-based and is intimidating at first. However, if we break down some of the commands, after some time, you quickly become familiar with using the terminal!

So far we've only covered the "**echo**" and "**whoami**" commands. Not all that useful when you consider things that we need to do - including navigating the filesystem, read and write to it as well.

In this task, we're going to be learning the commands so that we can do just that. Just like the previous task, I'll display the commands in the table in the next heading & show examples of these commands being used.

  

## Interacting With the Filesystem

As I previously stated, being able to navigate the machine that you are logged into without relying on a desktop environment is pretty important. After all, what's the point of logging in if we can't go anywhere?

Although it doesn't seem like it so far, one of the redeeming features of Linux is truly how efficient you can be with it. With that said, you can only be as efficient as you are familiar with it of course. As you interact with OSs such as Ubuntu over time, essential commands like those we've already covered will start to become muscle-memory.

One fantastic way to show just how efficient you can be with systems like this is using a set of commands to quickly search for files across the entire system that our user has access to. No need to consistently use `cd` and `ls` to find out what is where. Instead, we can use commands such as `find` to automate things like this for us!

This is where Linux starts to become a bit more intimidating to approach -- but we'll break this down and ease you into it.

## **Using Find**

The find command is fantastic in the sense that it can be used both very simply or rather complex depending upon what it is you want to do exactly. In fact, so much so, we have an entire room dedicated to using & practising the [find](https://tryhackme.com/room/thefindcommand) command. However, let's stick to the fundamentals first.

Take the snippet below, we can see a list of directories available to us:![[Pasted image 20220518193942.png]]
