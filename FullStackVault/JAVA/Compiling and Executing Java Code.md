[[Java]]

There are several steps that you need to follow to create a Java application. This tutorial shows you how to create a very simple Java application. If you need to create an enterprise application, the creation process is more complex but at its core you will find these simple steps.

The first of these steps is to write some Java code in a text editor.

Then this code has to be transformed to another format, which can be executed by your computer. This transformation is conducted by a special piece of software called a _compiler_. Some languages do not have a compiler; Java does. Every compiler is specific to a language.

The file produced by a compiler is often called a binary file or an executable file. Whereas you can read a source code and understand it, binary or executable files are not meant to be read by a human person. Only your computer can make sense of it.

This code contains special binary codes called _byte code_. This is a technical term that you may come across. The precise description of what is this _byte code_ is beyond the scope of this tutorial
