## System.out.println()

Inside the `main()` method, we can use the `println()` method to print a line of text to the screen:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
  System.out.println("Hello World");
}
```

**Note:** The curly braces `{}` marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.

`System` is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as `out`, which is short for "output". The `println()` method, short for "print line", is used to print a value to the screen (or a file).

Don't worry too much about `System`, `out` and `println()`. Just know that you need them together to print stuff to the screen.

You should also note that each code statement must end with a semicolon (`;`).
