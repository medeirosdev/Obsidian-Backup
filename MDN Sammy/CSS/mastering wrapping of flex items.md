###### wrapping and flex-direction
- if `flex-direction` is set to `row-reverse` then the items will start from the end edge of the container and lay themselves out in reverse ordered lines
###### collapsed items
- Specifying `visibility:collapse` on a flex item causes it to become a collapsed flex item, producing an effect similar to visibility:collapse on a table-row or table-column: the collapsed flex item is removed from rendering entirely, but leaves behind a "strut" that keeps the flex line's cross-size stable.
