- use `table-layout:fixed` to create a more predictable table layout that allows you to easily set column width by setting `width` on their headings (`<th>`)
- use `border-collpase:collpase` to make table elements border collapse into each other, producing a neater and easier to control look
- use `thead`, `tbody`, and `tfoot` to break up your table into logical chunks and provide extra places to apply CSS to
